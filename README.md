Greater Common Good
================

A personal collection of sanitized hacks, functions, scripts and programs for
public usage. I have learned much over the past 18+ years of dabbling in Linux
OS and its command line interface - via making a lot of mistakes and
documenting the lessons therefrom as well as with help from a plethora of
resources. Most of these play a critical role in my day to day existence in a 
wide range of projects.
